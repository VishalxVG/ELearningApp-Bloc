/// Possible App Errors 
    - Int is not a subtype of String
        This error says , the data returned is int , but we are storing it as a String
        During backend , the price was stored as decimal in backend , but in flutter local storage , we are storing it as a String
        That time we are getting this error 
        *> Solution : Convert the int returned to String using "toString()" function

    - The CourseList is not getting updated as it should 
        When u r calling HomePageCourseList event to update the HomePageStates , the state might not 
        get updated as it should
        The possible reason for this is that while getting data from the backend , we maybe calling the 
        couseItem before the data is getting updated
        *Solution : Only update the state if result.data is not empty
            meaning the bloc state will only update if the result is not empty




LOGIC SOFAR:

>> REGISTRATION:
    * RegisterController 
            - handleRegister(): 
                We pass our states to it , and call createUserWithEmailAndPassword()
                If user created , we send a verification mail 
                Update display name , and photo Url(From backend -> Php Laravel File -> ulearningApp/public/uploads/default.png)
                             
>> SIGNIN/LOGIN
    * SignInController
        -handleSignIn():
            We handle state first , then check for default errors 
            Check if user exist with that particular email and password
            If user exits , we make a loginRequestEntity object and pass values to it
            Then we pass the data into the backend by calling the api "UserApi" -> login method
            We use "Dio" package to call the api . we created another funciton "HttpUtil" that handles
            post , get , put etc funtions of the api .
            Then we use out Global function which updates out local storage with user tokens and user profile key
            THis "Global" is used to see if a user is already logined or not
